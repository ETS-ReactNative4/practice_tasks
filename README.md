# Practice Tasks

A repository for a few of my recent sample coding practice tasks

It currently includes 2 of my practice tasks:

---------------------------
1) Fluid WebPage (ClipMine)

A static web page created with emphasis on fluid design, created using HTML, CSS Grids, Flexbox

------------------------
2) Notebooks App (React)

- Creating Notes (Gist Files) using the user credentials (access token)
- Viewing Notes
- Editing Notes
- Deleting Notebooks

Steps to run the Notebooks App:
- Run command <code>yarn install</code> OR <code>npm install</code> on the root directory of Notebooks App to install the node packages.
- Now run Node Server as it contains API to get the GitHub Access Tokens on Backend. Use command:<br>
<code>node node-server.js</code>
- Finally, run the App by running the command <code>yarn start</code> OR <code>npm start</code> on the root directory.
- Access the app by using secure protocol: <code>https://localhost:8080</code>

A Sample Practice App involving the use of React, Redux, React Router, AntDesign, etc. Core functionalities of this App:
- Creating inventory items with user input.
