# Practice Tasks

A repository for a few of my recent sample coding practice tasks

It currently includes 2 of my practice tasks:

---------------------------
1) Fluid WebPage (ClipMine)
---------------------------

A static web page created with emphasis on fluid design, created using HTML, CSS Grids, Flexbox

------------------------
2) Notebooks App (React)
------------------------

A sample app demonstrating the use of ReactJS, MaterialUI, Webpack, React Router, etc. on Front End and an API
written in NodeJS on Back End. Core functionalities of this App:
- Authorizing GitHub User using OAuth Access Token and, hence, creating user session in the app.
- Creating Notebooks (Gists) using the user credentials (access token)
- Creating Notes (Gist Files) using the user credentials (access token)
- Viewing Notes
- Editing Notes
- Deleting Notebooks
